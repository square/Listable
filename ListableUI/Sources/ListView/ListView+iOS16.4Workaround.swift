/// ## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Good Morning! iOS Bug Workaround Ahead ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
///
/// iOS 16.4 introduced a regression (which was fixed in 16.5, then again broken in 17.0),
/// where on every `performBatchUpdates` applie to a `UICollectionView`, it would resign
/// the first responder if it was within a supplementary (header, footer) view.
/// This is a common position for search bars. Regular cells are not affected.
///
/// Square SEV: https://jira.sqprod.co/browse/ALERT-11928
///
/// ## Ok, how do we fix it?
///
/// Some initial thoughts using clever public-only workarounds, that turned out to not work for various reasons:
///
/// ### Override canResignFirstResponder/resignFirstResponder and return false
/// This would've been so easy! Alas, it triggers an assert  within `UICollectionView`:
/// ```
/// *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'The first responder contained inside of a deleted section or item refused to resign.
/// ```
///
/// ### Immediately re-becomeFirstResponder after collection view resigns it
/// In theory works, but for any screen that reloads the collection view as the result of a text field
/// becoming or resigning first responder, causes an infinite loop of updates. Not good!
///
/// ### Making `_resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithIndexPathMapping` a no-op
/// Too likely to break internal bits. As you can see in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kyleve/56da14d0dea1849ec12f2ec28ab472c1),
/// there's a lot of state management happening within there. Not a good idea!
///
/// Ok, that leaves us with...
///
/// ## Digging into private bits...
///
/// We can see, examining the stack trace of an affected supplementary view, that a method named
/// `_resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithIndexPathMapping` is performing the first responder resigning:
///
/// ```
/// TextFieldView.resignFirstResponder()
/// @objc TextFieldView.resignFirstResponder() ()
/// -[UICollectionView _resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithIndexPathMapping:] ()
/// -[UICollectionView _updateWithItems:tentativelyForReordering:propertyAnimator:collectionViewAnimator:] ()
/// -[UICollectionView _endItemAnimationsWithInvalidationContext:tentativelyForReordering:animator:collectionViewAnimator:] ()
/// -[UICollectionView _performBatchUpdates:completion:invalidationContext:tentativelyForReordering:animator:animationHandler:] ()
/// -[UICollectionView performBatchUpdates:completion:] ()
/// ```
///
/// Unfortunately, overriding that method to inspect the singular argument does not bear much fruit,
/// as the argument is a block:
///
/// ```
/// (lldb) po arg1
/// 0 elements
///
/// (lldb) po indexPathMapping
/// <__NSMallocBlock__: 0x600003c80e70>
///  signature: "@"NSIndexPath"16@?0@"NSIndexPath"8"
///  invoke   : 0x11d85d138 /// (/Applications/Xcode_14_2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS/// .simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/UIKitCore.framework/UIKitCore`__102-[UICollectionView /// _updateWithItems:tentativelyForReordering:propertyAnimator:collectionViewAnimator:]_block_invoke)
/// ```
///
/// Ok, damn. Well we tried. Also of note, the arguments to this method changed between iOS 16.3 and 16.4:
///
/// ```
/// // iOS 16.3
/// func _resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithUpdateItems(_ arg1 : Any, indexPathMapping: Any)
///
/// // iOS 16.4
/// func _resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithIndexPathMapping(_ arg : Any)
/// ```
///
/// It does seem like we've found where to dig in, though. Let's decompile that method with Hopper (https://www.hopperapp.com/),
/// a very useful app to have in your toolbox. It'll give you pseudocode-ish versions of various methods you want to inspect.
///
/// Doing that, we get this (snipped for brevity):
///
/// ```
/// -(void)_resignOrRebaseFirstResponderViewWithIndexPathMapping:(int)arg2 {
///     rdx = arg2;
///     rbx = arg1;
///     r15 = arg0;
///     r12 = [rdx retain];
///     if ([r15 _isFirstResponderInDeletedSectionOrItem] != 0x0) {
///             var_78 = rbx;
///             var_98 = r12;
///             r13 = *ivar_offset(_firstResponderView);
///             var_38 = *ivar_offset(_firstResponderIndexPath);
///             rbx = 0x0;
///             var_48 = r15;
///             var_40 = r13;
///             do {
///     ...
/// ```
///
/// Ok, that `_isFirstResponderInDeletedSectionOrItem` sure looks interesting. And it's a boolean
/// method to boot, too, so in theory it shouldn't have (m)any side effects we need to re-implement if we were
/// to override it and implement it ourselves. Lets try overriding it to see if that does what we want:
///
/// ```
/// class MyTestingCollectionView : UICollectionView {
///     @objc var _isFirstResponderInDeletedSectionOrItem : Bool {
///         false
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Hey, it works! Upon returning `false` from this method, the first responder remains
/// doing its first responder-y things. This means this is the way to go. Not great, but not awful.
///
/// To accomplish this, we'll re-implement the broken bits of `_isFirstResponderInDeletedSectionOrItem`
/// ourselves, and call back to the original implementation when we can.
///
