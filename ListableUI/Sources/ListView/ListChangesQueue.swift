/// A queue used to synchronized and serialize changes made to the backing collection view,
/// to work around either bugs or confusing behavior.
///
/// ## Handling Re-ordering (`isQueuingForReorderEvent`)
/// Collection View has an issue wherein if you perform a re-order event, and then within
/// the same runloop, deliver an update to the collection view as a result of that re-order event
/// that removes a row or section, the collection view will crash because it's internal index path
/// cache / data model has not yet been updated. Thus, in `collectionView(_:moveItemAt:to:)`,
/// we set this value to `true`, and then after one runloop, we set it back to `false`, after
/// the collection view's updates have "settled". Please see `sendEndQueuingEditsAfterDelay` for more.
///
/// ## Handling async batch updates (`add(async:)`)
/// Because we peform updates to _our_ backing data model (`PresentationState`) alongside
/// our collection view in order to make sure they remain in sync, we need to handle cases where
/// `UICollectionView.performBatchUpdates(_:completion:)` does not synchronously
/// invoke its `update` block, which means state can get out of sync.
/// See `updatePresentationStateWith(firstVisibleIndexPath:for:completion:)` for more.
///
/// ## Misc
/// Why not use `NSOperationQueue` here?
/// Namely, because we want operations to be synchronous when possible.
///
/// Eg, if if you perform the following changes:
///
/// ```
/// list.something()
///
/// // A synchronous operation.
/// queue.add {
///     doSomethingElse()
/// }
///
/// // An operation which may be synchronous or asynchronous,
/// // depending on when the completion callback fires.
/// queue.add { completion in
///     doAnotherThing(onCompletion: completion.finished)
/// }
/// ```
/// Where the first block can be run immediately (eg the queue is not paused),
/// it will be performed once the queue callback returns, and without jumping threads at all.
///
/// The second block might invoke its `onCompletion` immediately,
/// or it might take a runloop or two to do so. This implementation ensures
/// that if the completion block is invoked immediately (eg inline), the operation will also be synchronous.
/// The main use case for this case is `UICollectionView` callbacks which are sometimes
/// executed after a few runloop cycles – we don't want _every_ event going through
/// the queue to delay its completion by a runloop cycle unless we have to.
///
/// Only one operation will execute at once. This is a FIFO queue.
///
