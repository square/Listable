    /// Returns the size that a list with the provided properties would be, within the given `fittingSize`.
    ///
    /// This method works similarly to `sizeThatFits(_:)` on a `UIView`, returning the size of the
    /// content within the given `fittingSize`.
    ///
    /// - parameters:
    ///    - fittingSize: The size that the content should be measured in. This is the maximum
    ///     size that will be returned from this method.
    ///    - properties: The `ListProperties` which describe the content of the list.
    ///    - safeAreaInsets: The safe area to include when performing the layout.
    ///    - itemLimit: How many items from the content should be measured. The lower this number
    ///     (if lower then the count of items in the content), the faster this call will be, at the expense of a smaller
    ///     measurement size. If you know your `fittingSize` is constrained to, eg, the height of a device,
    ///     then relying on the default value of 50 is usually fine.
    ///
    /// ### Note
    /// This method attempts to be efficient – it does not allocate a `ListView` – instead it creates a layout,
    /// and presentation state – a subset of a usual list. It also re-uses measurement views across method calls
    /// (via static view caching) to further reduce allocations and improve speed and efficiency. Nevertheless,
    /// measuring the vertical or horizontal height of an entire list, especially large ones, can just be slow. You are
    /// encouraged to provide an `itemLimit` to reduce the amount of measurement that has to occur to
    /// calculate a height – especially if the `fittingSize` is known and finite.
