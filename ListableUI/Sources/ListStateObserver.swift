import Foundation

/// Allows reading state and events based on state changes within the list view.
/// For example, you can determine when a user scrolls, when the content of a list
/// changes, etc.
///
/// This is useful if you want to log these events to a logging or debugging system,
/// or potentially perform actions on the list based on some change.
///
/// Every callback has its own data type, filled with information relevant to that callback.
/// Every callback also contains a `ListActions` to perform actions back on the list.
///
/// You can register for each callback type multiple times – eg to split apart different pieces of
/// functionality. Eg, two calls to `onDidScroll` registers two callbacks.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```
/// ListStateObserver { observer in
///     observer.onDidScroll { info in
///         // Called whenever the list is scrolled.
///     }
///
///     observer.onContentChanged { info in
///         // Called when items are inserted or removed.
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Note
/// The duration of performing all callbacks is logged to `os_signpost`. If you find that
/// your application is running slowly, and you have registered `ListStateObserver` callbacks,
/// use Instruments.app to see what callback is slow.
///
