///
/// Provides configuration options to control how an ``Item`` can be reordered within a list.
///
/// To enable reordering on your ``Item``, assign the ``Item/reordering`` property,
/// configured as you need to control where the item can be reordered to.
///
/// In the example below, we set a ``ItemReordering`` config which allows
/// reordering the item within the current section, and when the reorder completes,
/// a controller is called to update the underlying data model.
/// ```swift
/// item.reordering = .init(sections: .current)
///
/// item.onWasReordered = { result in
///     myController.move(from: result.from, to: result.to)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you have many items, providing a ``Item/onWasReordered-swift.property`` callback for every item can be tedious.
///
/// In these cases, you can instead provide a ``ListStateObserver/onItemReordered(_:)`` callback,
/// which receives a ``ListStateObserver/ItemReordered`` value:
/// ```swift
/// list.stateObserver.onItemReordered { change in
///     myController.move(from: change.result.from, to: change.result.to)
/// }
/// ```
/// From which you can then read any changes and pass them through to your data model.
