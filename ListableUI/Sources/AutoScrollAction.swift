    /// If you would like to control if this scroll should occur on insert, pass a `shouldPerform` closure,

    /// including visible content edges and visible items. If you do not pass a `shouldPerform` closure,

    /// ### Example
    /// ```
    /// // ID of item which should trigger a scroll event (eg the last item in the list).
    /// let identifier = myItem.identifier
    ///
    /// let action = .scrollTo(

    ///    - position: The position to scroll the list to.
    ///    - animation: The animation type to perform. Note: Will only animate if the list update itself is animated.
