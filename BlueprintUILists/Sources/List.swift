/// A Blueprint element which can be used to display a Listable `ListView` within
/// an element tree.
///
/// You should use the `List` element as follows, just like you'd use the `configure(with:)` method
/// on `ListView` itself.
/// ```
/// List { list in
///     list.header = PodcastsHeader()
///
///     let podcasts = Podcast.podcasts.sorted { $0.episode < $1.episode }
///
///     list += Section("podcasts") { section in
///
///         section.header = PodcastsSectionHeader()
///
///         section += podcasts.map { podcast in
///             PodcastRow(podcast: podcast)
///         }

/// The parameter passed to the initialization closure is an instance of `ListProperties`,
/// which holds the various configuration options and content for the list. See `ListProperties` for
/// a full overview of all the configuration options available such as animation, layout configuration, etc.

/// When being laid out, a `List` will take up as much space as it is allowed. If you'd like to constrain
/// the size of a list, wrap it in a `ConstrainedSize`, or other size constraining element.
