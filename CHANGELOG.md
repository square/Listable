# [Main]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `ListHeaderPosition.fixed` would cause the list header to overlap with the refresh control by falling back to `sticky` behavior if there's a refresh control.

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Misc

# Past Releases

# [5.2.1] - 2022-07-21

### Fixed

- Fix a crash when initializing `Item`.

# [5.2.0] - 2022-07-20

### Changed

- `DefaultItemProperties` and `DefaultHeaderFooterProperties` now have all properties for each of `Item` and `HeaderFooter`.

# [5.1.0] - 2022-07-20

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `ListHeaderPosition.fixed` would cause the list header to overlap with the container header by falling back to `sticky` behavior if there's a container header.
- Supplementary items will now animate when their position in the layout changes.
- Fix an issue where horizontal list views would erroneously inset for the keyboard. Horizontal lists should not adjust for the keyboard, since it ends up causing vertical scrolling.

### Added

- Added a tint color to `SwipeAction` to configure `DefaultSwipeActionsView`. This allows customization of the text and image color (assuming a template image is used), where previously they were always white.  

# [5.0.1] - 2022-07-19

### Fixed

- Ensure `Optional` values from `DefaultItemProperties` and `DefaultHeaderFooterProperties` are respected.

# [5.0.0] - 2022-07-18

### Added

- `List` measurement now has options to include the `safeAreaInsets` from the `Environment` if the `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior` will affect the layout.

### Changed

- `stickyListHeader` has been replaced with `listHeaderPosition`, which has three possible values: `inline`, `sticky`, and `fixed`.

# [4.4.0] - 2022-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where child accessibility views could be exposed when they should be hidden. 

### Added

- Added `stickyListHeader` to layout / appearance, allowing you to pin list headers to the top of the content.

# [4.3.1] - 2022-07-11

### Fixed

- Ensure supplementary views are properly reused.

# [4.3.0] - 2022-07-02

### Fixed

- Supplementary views will now properly animate (fade) in and out when they are added or removed.

### Added

- Introduce `ContentContext`, an `Equatable` value which represents the overall context for all content presented in a list. Eg, you might pass a theme here, the traits for your screen (eg, dark mode, a11y settings, etc), or any other value which when changed, should cause the entire list to re-render. If the `ContentContext` changes across list renders, all list measurements will be thrown out and re-measured during the next render pass.

# [4.2.0] - 2022-06-01

### Added

- Added a pinning option `pin(to:)` which is very similar to `scrollToItem(onInsertOf:)` except that you don't specify an `onInsertOf` item.
- Adds a `bottomScrollOffset` property to `ListScrollPositionInfo`. You can use this to fine-tune pinning by only pinning when within a certain distance of the bottom scroll position.

# [4.1.0] - 2022-05-23

### Changed

- Enabled accessibility ordering, but only propagating the accessibility label reordering is possible and VoiceOver is active to avoid conflicting matches in KIF tests.

- `containerHeaders` in table and flow layouts now stretch to fill the available width of the view. Previously, 
they were inset with the content. 

# [4.0.0] - 2022-04-07

### Removed

- When using `BlueprintUILists`, layout is no longer forced during element updates. This will cause animations to no longer be inherited. Please use `.transition`, etc. to control animations.

# [3.2.1] - 2022-03-25

### Removed

- Removed item reordering with VoiceOver as it caused issues with KIF tests.

# [3.2.0] - 2022-03-21

### Fixed
- Fixed list measurements with container headers.

### Added
- Item reordering is now possible when using VoiceOver.

# [3.1.0] - 2022-02-08

### Added

- `ListReorderGesture.Begins` added. This controls when the reorder gesture starts: `onTap` and `onLongPress`.

# [3.0.0] - 2022-01-15

### Fixed

- `TableAppearance.ItemLayout` now properly initializes the `itemToSectionFooterSpacing` value.
- A swipe actions memory leak has been fixed for `ItemCell.ContentContainerView`.

### Added

- `LayoutDescription` now conforms to `Equatable`.
- `ListLayoutAppearance` now has a `func` to modify the default layout.
- You can now construct a layout description from a `ListLayoutAppearance`, allowing the underlying `ListLayout` to remain internal to a module.

# [2.0.0] - 2021-12-15

### Changed

- The signature of `ListLayout.layout(delegate:in:)` has been changed to return a `ListLayoutResult` value, to make it clearer which values must be provided as the output of a layout.

# [1.0.2] - 2021-12-14

### Changed

- When measuring a `List` in an unconstrained size constraint, and `.fillParent` is passed, a better assertion message is provided.

### Fixed

- Ensure that `.fillParent` `List` measurements returns the right height.

# [1.0.1] - 2021-12-06

### Added

- You may now set the `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior` on `.table` layouts. This is useful when presenting in a sheet, to more directly control the safe area inset.

- You can now control underflow bounce behavior on `.table` layouts, via `bounceOnUnderflow`.

# [1.0.0] - 2021-12-06

### Fixed

- Insert and removal animations for items now respect `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`, falling back to `.fade` if `isReduceMotionEnabled` is true.

### Added

- [Added support for `.horizontal` `.table` layouts](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/314). To get a horizontal table; just set the `layout.direction = .horizontal` when configuring your list's layout. Additionally, some properties were renamed from left/right to leading/trailing to better reflect they can now be on the left/top and right/bottom of a list view, respectively.

- Expose `layoutAppearanceProperties` on `LayoutDescription`, to access standard layout appearance properties without creating an instance of the backing layout.

- The `.flow` layout type has been added, to support flow and grid style layouts.

- `ListView.contentSize` will now also provide access to the natural width of a layout if the layout supports natural width calculation. This is useful, for example, to show a `.table` layout in a popover – you can now know how wide to render the popover.

- Added `.pagingBehaviour` to `.table` and `.flow` style layouts, which allows implementing carousel-style layouts, by enabling scroll paging alongside item boundaries.

### Removed

- The `.experimental_grid` layout type has been removed; it is replaced by `.flow`.

- Default sizes have been removed. Please ensure your elements correctly implement `sizeThatFits`, or use fixed sizes.

### Changed

- `scrollViewProperties` has moved from `ListLayout` to `ListLayoutAppearance`.

- The various `.table { ... }`, `.paged { ... }`, etc, `LayoutDescription` functions no longer take an escaping closure.

- `precondition` is now overridden within `ListableUI` and `BlueprintUILists` to point at an inlined function, which calls through to `fatalError`. This ensures that error messages are reported in crash reports.

# [0.30.1] - 2021-11-16

### Fixed

- Fix keyboard inset calculations by using `adjustedContentInset`.

# [0.30.0] - 2021-11-02

### Added

- Added support for result builders when creating lists, sections, and swipe actions:

    ```swift
    List {
        Section("id") {
            ExampleContent(text: "First Item")
            ExampleContent(text: "Second Item")
        } header: {
            ExampleHeader(title: "This Is My Section")
        } footer: {
            ExampleFooter(text: "Rules apply. Prohibited where void.")
        }
    }
    ```

### Changed

- `ListLayout` and its associated types are now public, allowing you to make custom layouts. Note that these APIs are still experimental and subject to change.

# [0.29.3] - 2021-10-22

### Fixed

- Ensure we properly pass through the `ListEnvironment` when updating on-screen views.

# [0.29.2] - 2021-10-21

### Fixed

- Fixed an erroneous `weak` reference in `SupplementaryContainerView` which lead to contents being deallocated too early – this is not actually needed. `HeaderFooterViewStatePair` holds the reference to the contained `AnyPresentationHeaderFooterState`, there are not direct strong references from `AnyPresentationHeaderFooterState` to `SupplementaryContainerView`.

# [0.29.1] - 2021-10-18

### Fixed

- Ensure that when comparing header/footer types during updates, we are comparing the correct underlying types in a `type(of:)` check.

# [0.29.0] - 2021-10-13

### Added

- [Introduced `swipeActionsStyle` property in `ItemContent` protocol](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/335). This allows clients to configure and specify different visual styles for swipe action views (such as `rounded` swipe actions).  

### Changed

- `onTap` on `HeaderFooter` now takes no parameters, to disambiguate it from `configure`.

# [0.28.0] - 2021-09-28

### Changed

- [Introduced `AnyHeaderFooterConvertible` for `HeaderFooters`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/332) contained in lists and sections, so you no longer need to wrap your `HeaderFooterContent` in a `HeaderFooter` to receive default values. Eg, you can now do:
    
    ```swift
    section.header = MyHeaderContent(title: "Albums")
    ```
    
    Instead of:

    ```swift
    section.header = HeaderFooter(MyHeaderContent(title: "Albums"))
    ```

# [0.27.1] - 2021-09-28

### Changed

- [Change the default sizing of `Item` and `HeaderFooter`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/331) to `.thatFits(.noConstraint)` from requiring the min from the layout. This is more common for self-sizing cells.

# [0.27.0] - 2021-09-15

### Changed

- [`clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear` was moved](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/326) to `ListViewController`.

# [0.26.1] - 2021-09-03

### Fixed

- Includes fix for header reuse from 0.25.1.

# [0.26.0] - 2021-08-14

### Added

- [You can now provide default list bounds for participating layouts](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/317) via the `environment.listContentBounds` property. This allows your containing screen, eg, to provide default bounds to ensure content lays out correctly. The `table` and `grid` layout types have been updated to read these content bounds.

### Removed

- [iOS 11 was deprecated](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/317).

### Changed

- [`ListSizing` was renamed to `List.Measurement`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/317), to reflect that it affects measurement and to align with Blueprint's terminology for measurement.

# [0.25.0] - 2021-08-12

### Added

- [Add support for `containerHeader`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/315), a header which can be added by the container which is displaying the list. This is useful for, eg, a custom navigation controller to add its large title view to the list's content. This header is not affected by the list's vertical padding.

# [0.24.0] - 2021-08-07

### Added

- [Add support for `ReappliesToVisibleView`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/288), which allows controlling when an on-screen view should have its content re-applied. 

# [0.23.2] - 2021-08-05

### Fixed

- [Ensure that scroll actions work](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/311) with horizontal lists.

# [0.23.1] - 2021-07-26

### Fixed

- [Fix two reordering crashes](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/308), which could happen when 1) a reorder signal resulted in an immediate deletion at the end of the list, and 2) a crash during scrolling during a reorder event.

# [0.23.0] - 2021-06-29

### Added

- [Introduce `defaultHeaderFooterProperties` on `HeaderFooterContent`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/304), to allow specifying default values for a `HeaderFooter` when values are not passed to the initializer.

# [0.22.2] - 2021-06-23

### Fixed

- Fixed `identifier(for:)` on `Section` to match name of `identifier(with:)` on `ItemContent`.

# [0.22.1] - 2021-06-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `Identifiable` conformance for `ItemContent`.

# [0.22.0] - 2021-06-22

### Misc

- Listable now depends on Blueprint `0.27.0` which has major breaking changes. There are no public changes to Listable, except public interfaces determined by Blueprint protocol conformance.

# [0.21.0] - 2021-06-17

### Fixed

- [When applying an update to visible views during content updates, the update now occurs within an animation block](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). This allows your view to inherit implicit animations more easily.

### Added

- [Reordering between multiple sections is now supported](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292).
- [Introduced type safe access to `Section` content following reorder events](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). See `Section.filtered`.
- [`ListStateObserver.onItemReordered` was added](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292) to observe reorder events at a list-wide level.
- [`ListLayout` was extended](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292) to allow customization of in-progress moves. Note that `ListLayout` is not yet public.

### Changed

- [`Reordering` has been renamed to `ItemReordering`, and a new `SectionReordering` has been introduced](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). This allows finer-grained control over validating reorder events at both the item level and section level.
- [`ListReorderGesture` and `ItemReordering.GestureRecognizer` have been heavily refactored](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292) to reduce visibility of internal state concerns.
- [`Item.identifier` has been renamed to `Item.anyIdentifier`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). The new `Item.identifier` property is now a fully type safe identifier.
- [`ReorderingActions` was refactored](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292) to expose less public state and ease use in UIView-backed list elements.
- [`Identifier<Represented>` is now `Identifier<Represented, Value>`; eg `Identifier<MyContent, UUID>`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). This is done to support reacting to reordering events in a more type safe manner, and to make `Identifier` creation more type safe. This is a large breaking change.
- [Changed how `identifier`s for `ItemContent` are represented](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292). `ItemContent` now returns a an identifier of a specific `IdentifierValue` (eg, `String`, `UUID`, etc), which is then assembled into an `Identifier` by the containing item. Additional APIs have been added for creating `Identifier`s in a more type safe manner. This is a large breaking change.

### Misc

- [The Blueprint-based shortcuts to create inline items and header footers have been renamed to `ElementItem` and `ElementHeaderFooter`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/292).

# [0.20.2] - 2021-04-19

### Fixed

- [Fixed the spacing between the header and the first section of a `TableListLayout`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/289) to not add the top padding.

# [0.20.1] - 2021-04-06

### Fixed

- [`TableListLayout` now maintains padding by default and with center alignments.](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/286)

# [0.20.0] - 2021-03-29

### Changed

- [Changed how `ListView.contentSize` is implemented](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/283) in order to improve performance. An internal list is no longer used, instead we create a layout and ask it to lay out its elements. `List.Measurement` also moved to `BlueprintUILists`, as that is the only place it was used. 

# [0.19.0] - 2021-03-22

### Added
- [Add support for adjusting the content offset](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/281) when the refresh control becomes visible with the `offsetAdjustmentBehavior` property.

Example usage:

```
list.content.refreshControl = RefreshControl(
    isRefreshing: isRefreshing,
    offsetAdjustmentBehavior: .displayWhenRefreshing(animate: true, scrollToTop: true),
    onRefresh: onRefresh
)
```

# [0.18.0] - 2021-03-12

### Fixed

- When calling `scrollToItem` with a `.top` scroll position, [the item no longer appears underneath sticky section headers](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/279). 

### Added

- [Adds `scrollToSection`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/277) to `ListActions` and `ListView`. To support this functionality, `Section` can now be queried with an `Identifier`. Also added `SectionPosition` to specify the top or bottom within a `Section`. 

Example usage:

```
listActions.scrolling.scrollToSection(
  with: MyItem.identifier(with: id),
  sectionPosition: .top,
  scrollPosition: ScrollPosition(position: .centered)
)
```

# [0.17.0] - 2021-03-10

### Fixed

- [When swiping to delete](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/270), limit overscrolling to 20% of the cell width. This prevents undesirable visual state while maintaining swipe bounciness. Additionally, ignore initial swipes to the right which do not "open" the cell.

- [Fixed a crash that occurred](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/271) when the list's width or height would become zero.

### Changed

- [Updates to `ItemContentCoordinator`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/274) to properly support animations in Blueprint-backed rows. This change also generalizes the contained animation type to `ViewAnimation`, for use in both scrolling and content updates.

# [0.16.0] - 2021-02-08

### Fixed

- [When updating `contentInset`, retain the values pulled from the `CollectionView`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/267). This is to avoid clobbering the content inset potentially set by other things like navigation controllers. 

### Changed

- [Rename `build` parameters to `configure`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/262), in order to be more consistent within the framework and with Blueprint.

# [0.15.1] - 2021-01-25

### Fixed

- [Fix a memory leak in `ListView`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/263) that caused all `ListViews` with content in them to leak.

# [0.15.0] - 2021-01-22

### Added

- [Introduce support for layout customization for `Item`, `HeaderFooter`, and `Section`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/257) for all `ListLayout` types, not just `.table`.

- [Add `inserted` and `removed` items to `.onContentChanged`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/260), to easily determine what content was added or removed from the list a central location.

### Changed

- [Rename `.list` layout to `.table`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/258), which is clearer, and also reduces confusion between `ListLayout` (the base protocol for layouts), and the specific table-type layout.

# [0.14.2] - 2021-01-21

### Fixed

- `SwipeActionsConfiguration.performsFirstActionWithFullSwipe` is now respected when set to `false`.

# [0.14.1] - 2021-01-06

### Fixed

- [Ensure that `ItemContent`s and `HeaderFooter`s are a value type](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/243). This is generally assumed by Listable, but was previously not validated. This is only validated in `DEBUG` builds, to avoid otherwise affecting performance. 

- [Fix a regression](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/246/) that caused content to be re-measured during each application of an `Appearance`, even if the new `Appearance` was equal.

### Added

- [Adds a way to create items or header/footers](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/206) for Blueprint lists without requiring the creation of a `BlueprintItemContent` or `BlueprintHeaderFooterContent`.

# [0.13.0] - 2020-12-14

### Added

- [Introduce `LocalizedItemCollator`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/236), a list-friendly version of `UILocalizedIndexedCollation` which allows collating a list of content at one time.

# [0.12.1] - 2020-12-01

### Fixed

- [Fixed frame setting calcuations, and fixed building in Xcode 11](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/234).

# [0.12.0] - 2020-12-01

### Fixed

- [Changed behavior of `scrollInsets` (now `scrollIndicatorInsets`)](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/222), which now only affects the scroll indicator insets of the contained scroll view, and does **not** affect the content inset of the scroll view. Please using `padding`, etc, on the various list layout types instead to control visual padding.

- [Ensure we respect both `frame` and `bounds` changes](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/227) to update the inner `CollectionView`'s frame. We previously used to only respect `frame` changes, but we should also respect `bounds` changes, as these are used by auto layout.

- [Fix support for `autolayout` items and headers/footers](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/228) by ensuring we pass through the correct `systemLayoutSizeFitting` calls to content. Add assertions that measured sizing is within a reasonable bound.

- [`Appearance.backgroundColor` now respects the current `UITraitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/231). This means that the background color will default to `white` in light mode, and `black` in dark mode.

- [Update `ListView.contentSize(in:for:)` to properly validate the provided `fittingSize`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/232). This ensures that `.unconstrained` measurements along the wrong axis will now assert; instead of freeze.

### Added

- [Introduce `onSelectionChanged` on `ListStateObserver`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/223) to allow observing when the selected rows change.

- [Pass through `BlueprintUI.Environment` to the `Element`s being rendered from `BlueprintItemContent` and `BlueprintHeaderFooterContent`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/225). This ensures that the content you put into a `List` respects the `BlueprintUI.Environment` of the `List` itself. This PR also introduces `ListEnvironment` to facilitate this, which allows similar passthrough of environment variables within Listable. 

- [Add a `didPerform` callback to `AutoScrollAction`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/229), which allows registering a callback when an auto scroll action occurs.

- [Change `animated` option on scrolling to an `animation` option`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/229), to allow customizing the animation's behavior.


# [0.11.0] - 2020-10-20

### Added

- Allow [setting the `sizing` type on a `List`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/202). This controls how the list should be sized by Blueprint: Should it take up all allowed space, or should it size to fit based on its content.

# [0.10.1] - 2020-10-01

- [Fixed import](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/215) of Swift bridging header, so Cocoapods can build with or without `use_frameworks!`.

# [0.10.0] - 2020-09-24

### Fixed

- [Adjust calculated keyboard inset in both `setFrame` and `layoutSubviews`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/200). This resolves issues that can occur if the list frame changes while the keyboard is visible.

### Added

- [Add support for `onInsert` , `onRemove`, `onMove`, `onUpdate`, on `Item`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/196) to track when when items are added, removed, moved, or updated. Changed `onContentChanged` to `onContentUpdated` on `ListStateObserver`; it is always called during updates; you can check the `hadChanges` property.

### Removed

- [Removed support for iOS 10](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/209). Future releases will only support iOS 11 and later.

### Changed

- [Change how keyboard are observed](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/199) to avoid a pitfall where the keyboard would not be accounted for if a `ListView` is created while a keyboard is already on screen. To avoid this problem, we switch to a globally shared `KeyboardObserver` which is loaded at app startup time.

- [`isEmpty` on `Content` and `Section` have been replaced with `contains(any:)`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/197), which allows more granular comparison of the content in the whole list and in individual sections, respectively. This allows you to check if the list or sections contain headers, footers, items, all, or some combination of them.

- Listable has been [renamed to ListableUI](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/211/), and BlueprintLists is now named BlueprintUILists. This is done to be more consistent with other Square UI libraries, and to avoid a conflict with an existing published Cocoapod, also named Listable.

# 0.9.0 - Internal Only

### Added

- [Add `ListScrollPositionInfo` to all `ListStateObserver` callbacks](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/191).

### Changed

- [Simplify `Sizing` now that enums support default associated values.](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/189). Now instead of separate `.thatFits` and `.thatFitsWith(Constraint)` enums, there is a single `.thatFits(Constraint = .noConstraint)` case (the same applies for `autolayout`).

- Changed [how `zIndexes` are assigned to header and items, and support tapping headers / footers](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/193). This allows registering an `onTap` handler for any HeaderFooter, and providing a background to display while the tap's press is active.

## 0.8.0 - Internal Only

### Added

- [Add support for `ListStateObserver`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/183) so that you can observe changes made to the list such as insertions, removals, scroll events, etc.

- [Add support for `ListActions`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/183) which allows performing actions on the underlying list view when used in a declarative environment, or when you otherwise do not have access to the underlying view instance (`ListStateViewController`).

- Add support for [Behavior.KeyboardAdjustmentMode](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/166), which allows for disabling automatic keyboard adjustment behavior. This is useful if your container view is managing the size of or insets on a `ListView` itself.

- [Introduced `callAsFunction` support](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/181) when building with Xcode 11.4 or later. This allows you to replace code like this:

  ```
  List { list in
      list += Section("first") { section in ... }
  }
  ```
  
  With this:
  
  ```
  List { list in
      list("first") { section in ... }
  }
  ```
  
  Improving terseness when building sections in a list.

- [`.paged()` is now a supported layout type.](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/178) This allows implementing your list to render similarly to a `UIPageViewController`, in either horizontal or vertical alignment.  
  

### Removed

- [Removed support for .`horiztonal` layouts](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/178) on `.table()` layouts. Now only `.vertical` is supported (this could return at a later date if needed).

### Changed

- [Changed `Section` initialization APIs](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/181) from `Section(identifier: "my-id") { ... }` to `Section("my-id") { ... }` – it's clear from the API what the first param is for, so the param name just made callsites longer.

- [Renamed `setContent` and `setProperties`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/178) methods on `ListView` to `configure`.

- [Significant refactors to how the custom layout APIs work.](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/178) While this is mostly an internal concern, it continues to refine these APIs to set them up for public exposure and usage at a later date to customize layouts.

## 0.7.0 - Internal Only

### Fixed

- [Significant performance improvements](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/179) for list updates which contain either no changes, or only in-place updates to existing items and sections. In many cases, these updates will now be 80% faster. This change also improves performance for other types of changes such as insertions, removals, or moves, but not to the same degree.

### Added

- [Added additional layout configuration options](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/173/): `headerToFirstSectionSpacing` and `lastSectionToFooterSpacing` now let you control the spacing between the list header and content, and the content and the list footer.

- [Add support for snapshot testing `Item`s](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/171) via the `ItemPreviewView` class. This is a view type which takes in some configuration options, and an `Item`, which you can then use in snapshot tests to verify the appearance of your `Item` and `ItemContent` .

  ```
  let view = ItemPreviewView()
          
  view.update(
      with: 300.0,
      state: .init(isSelected: false, isHighlighted: false),
      item: Item(MyItemContent(...))
  )

  self.takeSnapshot(of: view)
  ```

- [Add support for Xcode previews](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/171) via the `ItemPreview` type. This allows easy previewing your `ItemContent` during development like so:

  ```
  struct ElementPreview : PreviewProvider {
      static var previews: some View {
          ItemPreview.withAllItemStates(
              for: Item(XcodePreviewDemoContent(
                  text: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet (...)"
              ))
          )
      }
  }
  ```
  
  There are included options like `withAllItemStates` which allow seeing previews across the various possible selection and highlight states.

- Add `customInterSectionSpacing` property to `Section.Layout` which allows the user to specify [custom spacing after a section](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/172), overriding the calculated spacing.

- [Add `insertAndRemoveAnimations` to `Item`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/176) to allow customizing the animations used when an `Item` is inserted or removed from a list. Note that customizing this option when responding to `SwipeActions` will come at a later date.

- [Add `ListViewController`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/176) make it easy to create view controllers backed by a Listable `ListView`.

### Removed

### Changed

- Update `Item` callbacks to [allow for providing more info to the callback parameters](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/160).

- [`ListAppearance.Layout.padding` is now applied around all content in the list](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/173/), not only around sections. To regain the previous behavior, use `headerToFirstSectionSpacing` and `lastSectionToFooterSpacing`.

- Significantly change how [layout configuration is done](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/174) to make it clearer which type of layout is currently in use, and which options are available on which layouts.

  Previously, to configure a layout, you would write code like this:

  ```
  list.appearance.layoutType = .table
  list.appearance.table.layout.padding = UIEdgeInsets(...)
  ```

  Now, you configure the layout like this:

  ```
  list.layout = .table {
    $0.layout.padding = UIEdgeInsets(...)
  }
  ```

  Or, for your custom layouts, like this:

  ```
  list.layout = MyCustomLayout.describe {
    $0.myLayoutsProperty = .foo
  }
  ```

### Misc

## 0.6.1 - Internal Only

### Changed

- Change `Item`'s `onSelect` and `onDeselect` [to be performed asynchronously](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/155) after a single runloop spin, to give `UICollectionView` time to schedule animations if these callbacks are slow.
- Add improved signpost logging for selection and deselection, to more easily identify slow callbacks.

## 0.6.0 - Internal Only

### Fixed

- Fixed [multiple selection and highlight issues](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/153): Highlighting cells now only occurs if the `selectionStyle` is `tappable` or `selectable`. Ensure that when `tappable` is provided, the content of a cell is updated when the cell is deselected.

### Added

- Added type aliases for `HeaderFooter` and `HeaderFooterContent` to reduce verbosity of use. Now instead of typing `HeaderFooter(MyHeader())`, you can use `Header(MyHeader())`.
- Replace unused / experimental `Binding` type [with `Coordinator`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/143), which allows you to independently manage item state in a similar manner to SwiftUI's `UIViewRepresentable`'s `Coordinator`.

### Removed

### Changed

- **Major Change:** `ItemElement` and `HeaderFooterElement` [were renamed to `ItemContent` and `HeaderFooterContent`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/150), respectively. This is intended to be a clearer indicaton as to what they are for (the content of an item or header/footer), and fixes a name collision with Blueprint, where we overloaded the meaning of `Element` when using Blueprint integration via `BlueprintUILists`.
- Changed `BlueprintHeaderFooter{Content/Element}`'s main method to be `elementRepresentation` instead of `element`. This allows easier conformance of `BlueprintUI.ProxyElement` types to `BlueprintHeaderFooter{Content/Element}`.
- `SelectionMode` [was moved from `Content` to `Behavior`](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/152), which is in line with other collection view behaviours like scrolling and underflow.
- Rename `ItemSelectionStyle.none` to `ItemSelectionStyle.notSelectable`. This is to avoid conflicts with `Optional.none` when working with `ItemSelectionStyle` as an `Optional`.

## 0.5.0 - Internal Only

### Added

- Added support for [conditionally scrolling to items](https://github.com/kyleve/Listable/pull/129) on insert, based on the `shouldPerform` block passed to the `AutoScrollAction`.
